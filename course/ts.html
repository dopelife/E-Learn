 JavaScript was introduced as a language for the client side. The development of Node.js has marked JavaScript as an emerging server-side technology too. However, as JavaScript code grows, it tends to get messier, making it difficult to maintain and reuse the code. Moreover, its failure to embrace the features of Object Orientation, strong type checking and compile-time error checks prevents JavaScript from succeeding at the enterprise level as a full-fledged server-side technology. TypeScript was presented to bridge this gap.
<br><h3>
<br>
What is TypeScript?
</h3>
By definition,<b> “TypeScript is JavaScript for application-scale development.”</b>

TypeScript is a strongly typed, object oriented, compiled language. It was designed by Anders Hejlsberg (designer of C#) at Microsoft. TypeScript is both a language and a set of tools. TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript compiled to JavaScript. In other words, TypeScript is JavaScript plus some additional features.

</p>

<h3>Features of TypeScript</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>TypeScript is just JavaScript.</b><br> TypeScript starts with JavaScript and ends with JavaScript. Typescript adopts the basic building blocks of your program from JavaScript. Hence, you only need to know JavaScript to use TypeScript. All TypeScript code is converted into its JavaScript equivalent for the purpose of execution.</li>

<li><b>TypeScript supports other JS libraries.</b><br>Compiled TypeScript can be consumed from any JavaScript code. TypeScript-generated JavaScript can reuse all of the existing JavaScript frameworks, tools, and libraries.</li>

<li><b>JavaScript is TypeScript.</b><br> This means that any valid .js file can be renamed to .ts and compiled with other TypeScript files.</li>

<li><b>TypeScript is portable.</b><br> TypeScript is portable across browsers, devices, and operating systems. It can run on any environment that JavaScript runs on. Unlike its counterparts, TypeScript doesn’t need a dedicated VM or a specific runtime environment to execute.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h4>TypeScript and ECMAScript</h4>

The ECMAScript specification is a standardized specification of a scripting language. There are six editions of ECMA-262 published. Version 6 of the standard is codenamed "Harmony". TypeScript is aligned with the ECMAScript6 specification.
TypeScript adopts its basic language features from the ECMAScript5 specification, i.e., the official specification for JavaScript. TypeScript language features like Modules and class-based orientation are in line with the EcmaScript 6 specification. Additionally, TypeScript also embraces features like generics and type annotations that aren’t a part of the EcmaScript6 specification.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Why Use TypeScript?</h3>

TypeScript is superior to its other counterparts like CoffeeScript and Dart programming languages in a way that TypeScript is extended JavaScript. In contrast, languages like Dart, CoffeeScript are new languages in themselves and require language-specific execution environment.
<br>
<b>The benefits of TypeScript include −</b>
<ul>
   <li> Compilation − JavaScript is an interpreted language. Hence, it needs to be run to test that it is valid. It means you write all the codes just to find no output, in case there is an error. Hence, you have to spend hours trying to find bugs in the code. The TypeScript transpiler provides the error-checking feature. TypeScript will compile the code and generate compilation errors, if it finds some sort of syntax errors. This helps to highlight errors before the script is run.</li>

 <li>   Strong Static Typing − JavaScript is not strongly typed. TypeScript comes with an optional static typing and type inference system through the TLS (TypeScript Language Service). The type of a variable, declared with no type, may be inferred by the TLS based on its value.</li>

   <li> TypeScript supports type definitions for existing JavaScript libraries. TypeScript Definition file (with .d.ts extension) provides definition for external JavaScript libraries. Hence, TypeScript code can contain these libraries.</li>

    <li>TypeScript supports Object Oriented Programming concepts like classes, interfaces, inheritance, etc.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Components of TypeScript</h3>
<br>
At its heart, TypeScript has the following three components −
<ul>
    <li><b>Language</b> − It comprises of the syntax, keywords, and type annotations.</li>

    <li><b>The TypeScript Compiler</b> − The TypeScript compiler (tsc) converts the instructions written in TypeScript to its JavaScript equivalent.</li>

    <li><b>The TypeScript Language Service</b> − The "Language Service" exposes an additional layer around the core compiler pipeline that are editor-like applications. The language service supports the common set of a typical editor operations like statement completions, signature help, code formatting and outlining, colorization, etc.</li>
</ul>
</p>

</div>

<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade cont"  id="chap2"> 
<p><h3>TypeScript Basic Syntax</h3><br>
Syntax defines a set of rules for writing programs. Every language specification defines its own syntax. A TypeScript program is composed of −
<ul>
    <li>Modules</li>
    <li>Functions</li>
    <li>Variables</li>
    <li>Statements and Expressions</li>
    <li>Comments</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Your First TypeScript Code</h3>

Let us start with the traditional “Hello World” example −
<pre class="prettyprint">
var message:string = "Hello World" 
console.log(message)
</pre>
On compiling, it will generate following JavaScript code.
<pre class="prettyprint">
//Generated by typescript 1.8.10
var message = "Hello World";
console.log(message);
</pre>
<ul>
    <li>Line 1 declares a variable by the name message. Variables are a mechanism to store values in a program.</li>

    <li>Line 2 prints the variable’s value to the prompt. Here, console refers to the terminal window. The function log () is used to display text on the screen.</li>
	</ul>

<h3>Compile and Execute a TypeScript Program</h3>

Let us see how to compile and execute a TypeScript program using Visual Studio Code. Follow the steps given below −
<ul>
<li>
Step 1 − Save the file with .ts extension. We shall save the file as Test.ts. The code editor marks errors in the code, if any, while you save it.</li>

<li>Step 2 − Right-click the TypeScript file under the Working Files option in VS Code’s Explore Pane. Select Open in Command Prompt option.</li>
<li>Step 3 − To compile the file use the following command on the terminal window.</li>
<pre class="prettyprint">
tsc Test.ts
</pre>
<li>Step 4 − The file is compiled to Test.js. To run the program written, type the following in the terminal.</li>
<pre class="prettyprint">
node Test.js
</pre>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h3>Identifiers in TypeScript</h3>
Identifiers are names given to elements in a program like variables, functions etc. The rules for identifiers are −
<ul>
    <li>Identifiers can include both, characters and digits. However, the identifier cannot begin with a digit.</li>

    <li>Identifiers cannot include special symbols except for underscore (_) or a dollar sign ($).</li>

    <li>Identifiers cannot be keywords.</li>

    <li>They must be unique.</li>

    <li>Identifiers are case-sensitive.</li>

    <li>Identifiers cannot contain spaces.</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
<h4>Whitespace and Line Breaks</h4>

TypeScript ignores spaces, tabs, and newlines that appear in programs. You can use spaces, tabs, and newlines freely in your program and you are free to format and indent your programs in a neat and consistent way that makes the code easy to read and understand.

<h4>TypeScript is Case-sensitive</h4>
TypeScript is case-sensitive. This means that TypeScript differentiates between uppercase and lowercase characters.

<h4>Semicolons are optional</h4>

Each line of instruction is called a statement. Semicolons are optional in TypeScript.

<b>Example</b>
<pre class="prettyprint">
console.log("hello world")
console.log("We are learning TypeScript")
</pre>
A single line can contain multiple statements. However, these statements must be separated by a semicolon.
<h4>Comments in TypeScript</h4>
Comments are a way to improve the readability of a program. Comments can be used to include additional information about a program like author of the code, hints about a function/ construct etc. Comments are ignored by the compiler.
<b>TypeScript supports the following types of comments −</b>
<ul>
   <li> Single-line comments ( // ) − Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment</li>

    <li>Multi-line comments (/* */) − These comments may span multiple lines.</li>
<ul>
<b>Example</b>
<pre class="prettyprint">
//this is single line comment 
 
/* This is a  
   Multi-line comment 
*/
</pre>
</p>

</div>
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade cont" id="chap3"><p><h3>Compiler Flags</h3>

Compiler flags enable you to change the behavior of the compiler during compilation. Each compiler flag exposes a setting that allows you to change how the compiler behaves.

The following table lists some common flags associated with the TSC compiler. A typical command-line usage uses some or all switches.
<table>
<tr><th>S.NO</th><th>  Compiler Flag & Description</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td><b>--help</b><br>

Displays the help manual</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td> 	

<b>--module</b><br>

Load external modules</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td><b>--target</b><br>

Set the target ECMA version</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td><b>--declaration</b><br>

Generates an additional .d.ts file</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td><b>--removeComments</b><br>

Removes all comments from the output file</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td><b>--out</b><br>

Compile multiple files into a single output file</td></tr>
<tr><td>7</td><td> 	

<b>--sourcemap</b><br>

Generate a sourcemap (.map) files</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td><b>--module noImplicitAny</b><br>

Disallows the compiler from inferring the any type</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td><b>--watch
</b><br>
Watch for file changes and recompile them on the fly</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<h3>TypeScript - Types</h3>
The Type System represents the different types of values supported by the language. The Type System checks the validity of the supplied values, before they are stored or manipulated by the program. This ensures that the code behaves as expected. The Type System further allows for richer code hinting and automated documentation too.

TypeScript provides data types as a part of its optional Type System. The data type classification is as given below − <br>
<img src="../images/any.png" alt="Types">
<h4>The Any type</h4>

The any data type is the super type of all types in TypeScript. It denotes a dynamic type. Using the any type is equivalent to opting out of type checking for a variable.

<h4>Built-in types</h4>
The following table illustrates all the built-in types in TypeScript −
<table>
<tr><th>Data Type</th>
<th>Keyword</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr><td>Number 	</td>
<td>number</td>
<td>Double precision 64-bit floating point values. It can be used to represent both, integers and fractions.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>String</td>
<td>string</td>
<td>Represents a sequence of Unicode characters</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Boolean</td>
<td>boolean</td>
<td>Represents logical values, true and false</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Void</td>
<td>void</td>
<td>Used on function return types to represent non-returning functions</td>
</tr>
<tr><td>Null</td>
<td>null</td>
<td>Represents an intentional absence of an object value.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td> Undefined</td>
<td> undefined</td>
<td>Represents an intentional absence of an object value.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<h4>Null and undefined ─ Are they the same?</h4>

The null and the undefined datatypes are often a source of confusion. The null and undefined cannot be used to reference the data type of a variable. They can only be assigned as values to a variable.

However, null and undefined are not the same. A variable initialized with undefined means that the variable has no value or object assigned to it while null means that the variable has been set to an object whose value is undefined.
<h3>User-defined Types</h3>

User-defined types include Enumerations (enums), classes, interfaces, arrays, and tuple. These would be discussed in detail in the later chapters.
</p>
</div>
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade cont" id="chap4"> 
<p><h3>TypeScript Variables</h3>
A variable, by definition, is “a named space in the memory” that stores values. In other words, it acts as a container for values in a program. TypeScript variables must follow the JavaScript naming rules −

    <li>Variable names can contain alphabets and numeric digits.</li>

    <li>They cannot contain spaces and special characters, except the underscore (_) and the dollar ($) sign.</li>

    <li>Variable names cannot begin with a digit.</li>
</ul>

A variable must be declared before it is used. Use the var keyword to declare variables.
The type syntax for declaring a variable in TypeScript is to include a colon (:) after the variable name, followed by its type. Just as in JavaScript, we use the var keyword to declare a variable.
<b><br>The following table illustrates the valid syntax for variable declaration as discussed above −</b>
<table>
<tr>
<th>S.No.</th><th>Variable Declaration Syntax & Description</th></tr>
<tr>
<td>1. </td>	

<td>var name:string = ”mary

The variable stores a value of type string</td></tr>
<tr><td>2. 	
</td>
<td>var name:string;

The variable is a string variable. The variable’s value is set to undefined by default</td></tr>
<tr><td>3. 	
</td>
<td>var name = ”mary”

The variable’s type is inferred from the data type of the value. Here, the variable is of the type string</td></tr>
<tr><td>4. 	
</td><td>
var name;

The variable’s data type is any. Its value is set to undefined by default.</td></tr></table>
</p>
<p>
<b>Example: Variables in TypeScript</b>
<pre class="prettyprint">
var name:string = "John"; 
var score1:number = 50;
var score2:number = 42.50
var sum = score1 + score2 
console.log("name"+name) 
console.log("first score: "+score1) 
console.log("second score: "+score2) 
console.log("sum of the scores: "+sum)
</pre>
<b>On compiling, it will generate following JavaScript code.</b>
<pre class="prettyprint">
//Generated by typescript 1.8.10
var name = "John";
var score1 = 50;
var score2 = 42.50;
var sum = score1 + score2;
console.log("name" + name);
console.log("first score: " + score1);
console.log("second score : " + score2);
console.log("sum of the scores: " + sum);
</pre>
<b>The output of the above program is given below −</b>
<pre class="prettyprint">
name:John 
first score:50 
second score:42.50 
sum of the scores:92.50
</pre>
</p>
<p><h3>Type Assertion in TypeScript</h3>

TypeScript allows changing a variable from one type to another. TypeScript refers to this process as Type Assertion. The syntax is to put the target type between < > symbols and place it in front of the variable or expression. The following example explains this concept −
<b>Example</b>
<pre class="prettyprint">
var str = '1' 
var str2:number = <number> <any> str   //str is now of type number 
console.log(typeof(str2))
</pre>
<b>On compiling, it will generate following JavaScript code.</b>
<pre class="prettyprint">
"use strict";
var str = '1';
var str2 = str; //str is now of type number 
console.log(typeof (str2));
</pre>
<b>It will produce the following output −</b>
<pre class="prettyprint">
string
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<h3>TypeScript Variable Scope</h3>

The scope of a variable specifies where the variable is defined. The availability of a variable within a program is determined by its scope. TypeScript variables can be of the following scopes −
<ul>
   <li><b>Global Scope −</b> Global variables are declared outside the programming constructs. These variables can be accessed from anywhere within your code.</li>

    <li><b>Class Scope −</b> These variables are also called fields. Fields or class variables are declared within the class but outside the methods. These variables can be accessed using the object of the class. Fields can also be static. Static fields can be accessed using the class name.</li>

    <li><b>Local Scope − </b>Local variables, as the name suggests, are declared within the constructs like methods, loops etc. Local variables are accessible only within the construct where they are declared.</li>

<b>The following example illustrates variable scopes in TypeScript.
Example: Variable Scope</b>
<pre class="prettyprint">
var global_num = 12          //global variable 
class Numbers { 
   num_val = 13;             //class variable 
   static sval = 10;         //static field 
   
   storeNum():void { 
      var local_num = 14;    //local variable 
   } 
} 
console.log("Global num: "+global_num)  
console.log(Numbers.sval)   //static variable  
var obj = new Numbers(); 
console.log("Global num: "+obj.num_val) 
</pre>
<b>On transpiling, the following JavaScript code is generated −</b>
<pre class="prettyprint">
var global_num = 12;              //global variable 
var Numbers = (function () {
   function Numbers() {
      this.num_val = 13;          //class variable 
   }
   Numbers.prototype.storeNum = function () {
      var local_num = 14;        //local variable 
   };
   Numbers.sval = 10;            //static field 
   return Numbers;
}());

console.log("Global num: " + global_num);
console.log(Numbers.sval);       //static variable  

var obj = new Numbers();
console.log("Global num: " + obj.num_val);
</pre>
<b>It will produce the following output −</b>
<pre class="prettyprint">
Global num: 12
10
Global num: 13
</pre>
<b>If you try accessing the local variable outside the method, it results in a compilation error.</b>
<pre class="prettyprint">
error TS2095: Could not find symbol 'local_num'.
</pre>
</p>
</div>
<div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade cont" id="chap5">
<p><h3>Typescript - Operators</h3>
<b>What is an Operator?</b>

An operator defines some function that will be performed on the data. The data on which operators work are called operands.<b> Consider the following expression −

7 + 5 = 12
</b>
Here, the values 7, 5, and 12 are operands, while + and = are operators.

<b>The major operators in TypeScript can be classified as −</b>
<ul>
   <li> Arithmetic operators</li>
   <li> Logical operators</li>
    <li>Relational operators</li>
    <li>Bitwise operators</li>
    <li>Assignment operators</li>
    <li>Ternary/conditional operator</li>
    <li>String operator</li>
    <li>Type Operator</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><h4>Arithmetic Operators</h4>

Assume the values in variables a and b are 10 and 5 respectively.

<table>
<tr><th>Operator </th><th>Description </th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>+ (Addition) </td><td>	returns the sum of the operands </td><td>a + b is 15</td></tr>
<tr><td>- (Subtraction) </td><td>returns the difference of the values </td><td>	a - b is 5</td></tr>
<tr><td>* (Multiplication) </td><td>returns the product of the values </td><td>a * b is 50</td></tr>
<tr><td>/ (Division) </td><td>	performs division operation and returns the quotient </td><td>	a / b is 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>% (Modulus) </td><td>	performs division operation and returns the remainder </td><td>	a % b is 0</td></tr>
<tr><td>++ (Increment) </td><td>	Increments the value of the variable by one </td><td>	a++ is 11</td></tr>
<tr><td>-- (Decrement)</td><td> 	Decrements the value of the variable by one </td><td>	a-- is 9</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<h4>Relational Operators</h4>


Relational Operators test or define the kind of relationship between two entities. Relational operators return a Boolean value, i.e., true/ false.

Assume the value of A is 10 and B is 20.
<table>
<tr><th>Operator </th><th>Description</th><th>Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>> 	</td><td>Greater than </td><td>(A > B) is False</td></tr>
<tr><td>< </td><td>	Lesser than </td><td>	(A < B) is True </td></tr>
<tr><td>>= 	</td><td>Greater than or equal to </td><td>	(A >= B) is False</td></tr>
<tr><td><= 	</td><td>Lesser than or equal to 	</td><td>(A <= B) is True</td></tr>
<tr><td>== </td><td>	Equality</td><td> 	(A == B) is false</td><tr>
<tr><td>!= 	</td><td>Not equal </td><td>(A != B) is True</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<h4>Logical Operators</h4>

Logical Operators are used to combine two or more conditions. Logical operators too return a Boolean value. Assume the value of variable A is 10 and B is 20.

<table>
<tr><th>Operator </th><th>	Description </th><th>	Example</th></tr>
<tr><th>&& (And) </th><th>	The operator returns true only if all the expressions specified return true </th><th>(A > 10 && B > 10) is False</th></tr>
<tr><th>|| (OR) </th><th>The operator returns true if at least one of the expressions specified return true  </th><th>	(A > 10 || B >10) is True</th></tr>
<tr><th>! (NOT) </th><th>	The operator returns the inverse of the expression’s result. For E.g.: !(>5) returns false </th><th>	!(A >10 ) is True</th></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<h4>Bitwise Operators</h4>

Assume variable A = 2 and B = 3
<table>
<tr><th>Operator </th><th>Description</th><th> 	Example</th></tr>
<tr><td>& (Bitwise AND)</td><td> 	It performs a Boolean AND operation on each bit of its integer arguments. </td><td>	(A & B) is 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>| (BitWise OR) </td><td>	It performs a Boolean OR operation on each bit of its integer arguments. </td><td>	(A | B) is 3 </td></tr>
<tr><td>^ (Bitwise XOR) </td><td>	It performs a Boolean exclusive OR operation on each bit of its integer arguments. Exclusive OR means that either operand one is true or operand two is true, but not both. </td><td>	(A ^ B) is 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>~ (Bitwise Not) </td><td>It is a unary operator and operates by reversing all the bits in the operand. </td><td>	(~B) is -4</td></tr>
<tr><td><< (Left Shift) </td><td>	It moves all the bits in its first operand to the left by the number of places specified in the second operand. New bits are filled with zeros. Shifting a value left by one position is equivalent to multiplying it by 2, shifting two positions is equivalent to multiplying by 4, and so on. </td><td>	(A << 1) is 4</td></tr>
<tr><td>>> (Right Shift) </td><td>	Binary Right Shift Operator. The left operand’s value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand. </td><td>	(A >> 1) is 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>>>> (Right shift with Zero) </td><td>	This operator is just like the >> operator, except that the bits shifted in on the left are always zero. </td><td>	(A >>> 1) is 1</td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
<h4>Assignment Operators</h4>
<table>
<tr><th>Operator </th><th>	Description </th><th>	Example </th></tr>
<tr><td>= (Simple Assignment) </td><td>	Assigns values from the right side operand to the left side operand </td><td>	C = A + B will assign the value of A + B into C</td></tr>
<tr><td>+= (Add and Assignment) </td><td>	It adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. </td><td>	C += A is equivalent to C = C + A</td></tr>
<tr><td>-= (Subtract and Assignment) </td><td>	It subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. </td><td>	C -= A is equivalent to C = C - A</td></tr>
<tr><td>*= (Multiply and Assignment) </td><td>	It multiplies the right operand with the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand. </td><td>	C *= A is equivalent to C = C * A</td></tr>
<tr><td>/= (Divide and Assignment) </td><td>	It divides the left operand with the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand. 	</td></tr>
